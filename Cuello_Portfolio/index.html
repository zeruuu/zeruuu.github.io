                    Hello, my name is <b>Eugene Andreu J. Cuello</b> from A221, <br> 
                    Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. <br><br>
                    Coming from an animation strand during senior high school <br> 
                    and as an occassional self-taught video editor, designing a <br> 
                    website with prior knowledge to coding ignites a spark <br> 
                    within me, telling me that these skills might be a good fit for me.

                <div id = "progress_desc">
                    <p>Without any prior knowledge with web programming and designing except for a few html tags,
                        it has been a bit rough at the start, but it seems easy to learn as I progress:

                    <p>This also applied to the second assignment I had, which is about making a table for our course schedule:

                    <p>
                    What we have here is our first CSS activity. I had confusions at first on how to balance thing out when it comes to sizing.
                    </p>
                    <img src = 'imgs/css1img.png' id = "css_img">

                    <p>
                    Here is our second CSS activity. It started to get easier even without the help of flexbox.
                    </p>
                    <img src = 'imgs/css2img.png' id = "css_img">

                    <p>
                    Here is our third CSS activity. It was a bit of a challenge without prior knowledge regarding box sizing.

                    Lastly our fourth CSS activity. It is very hard to position elements without the help of flexbox.

                    is the same.

                    A date subtraction calculator that calculates the difference of two different dates by days.

                    Here is my first application made during first year, a mini inventory management system titled '<b>Mininventory</b>'.
                    With the lack of UI design knowledge, this was the best my beginner self could do at that time.

                    One of my achievements outside of coding in this field of programming during <b>CCIS Week</b> last 2024. It's not much 
                    but still an achievement nonetheless.

                    This time, I am getting the grasp of learning UI design along with event listeners and data management.
